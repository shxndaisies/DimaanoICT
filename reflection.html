I learned so much in the first quarter of ICT. I have learned more about HTML and new things to do with it!<br>
Back then, I did not know I could add a list to an HTML document or even create a form. I didn't know <br>
how to create hyperlinks too. Now I know how to do these things and it made me more inspired to create <br>
better webpages.
