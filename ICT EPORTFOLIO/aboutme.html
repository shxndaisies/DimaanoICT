<p>
Hi! I am Shanelle Ann Margaret T. Dimaano, a 14-year-old student from 9-Fairness. My favorite color is definitely pink! <br> 
I have a passion for many types of art such as painting, drawing, crocheting, and knitting. Ever since I was a child, I have always <br>
been a diligent student who always strives to do her best. I have been through challenges but I always persevere.
